# LuckyRedPacket
Using SpringBoot and MySql to build an RedPacket transmission system. 
 
During the Chinese new year, as a father, I will send red packets to little kids. I build this project to practice and show my ability using spring-boot and MySql. I will update it with the front-end viewer later.
